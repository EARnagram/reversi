## Ongoing

### Repeatability
- As a user, I'd like the board to refresh after the end of a game
- I'd like the background color to change based on victor (or tie) of previous game

### Design
- As a user, I'd like the hover effect to show only playable moves
- As a user, I'd like the hover effect to prompt the next move by showing next color play
- As a user, I'd like the hover effect to preview the result of the move
- As a user, I'd like the colors to slowly transition so I can see the results of the moves (use jquery ui)
- As a user, I'd like the colors to compliment each other beautifully
