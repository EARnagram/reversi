# MVP

## Ongoing
### Basic Structure
- ~~As a user, I'd like to see an 8x8 board~~
- ~~As a user, I'd like a hover effect to show over cells~~
- ~~As a user, I'd like the first moves to be in place when I start the game~~
	- ~~white = 4d, 5e~~
	- ~~black = 4e, 5d~~
- ~~As a user, I'd like each cell to only be played on once~~
- ~~As a user, I'd like each player to represent a certain color~~


### Move Logic
- ~~As a user, I'd like black to move first on the first game~~
- As a user, I'd like for a move to only take place if the player places a piece in such a position that there exists at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new piece and another piece of their color, with one or more contiguous other player's pieces sandwiched between them
- As a user, I'd like to skip a player if that player does not have the option to make a legal move

### Win Logic
- As a user, I'd like a win to occur when:
	- No moves exist
	- A player has been wiped from the board
	- Game board is completely filled (most common)
