# MVP

## Ongoing
### Basic Structure
- As a user, I'd like to see an 8x8 board
- Start with players on center squares
	- white = 4d, 5e
	- black = 4e, 5d
- assign players using classes
- each class represents a certain color


### Move Logic
- Black moves first
- Player must place a piece with their color on the board, in such a position that there exists at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new piece and another piece of their color, with one or more contiguous pieces of the other color between them

### Win Logic
- No moves exist
- A player has been wiped from the board
- Game board is completely filled (most common)
